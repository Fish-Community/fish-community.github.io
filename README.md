## Getting started

Using [Bun](https://bun.sh/), install all the needed dependencies:

```sh
bun install
```

To compile your [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) code, run:

```sh
bun build:elm
```

To compile your [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) stylesheets, run:

```sh
bun build:sass
```

To see your changes, use any web server. Python itself has a built-in one:

```sh
python3 -m http.server
```
